# Loops : When you want to run an action for certain number of times, we use loops.

# There are 2 major types of loops ; 
#     1) For loop       ( When you know something to be executed n number of time, we use for loop)
#     2) While loop     ( When you don't know something to be executed n number of times, we use while loop)

# echo Value is 10
# echo Value is 20 
# echo Value is 30
# echo Value is 40
# echo Value is 50
